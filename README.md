viq-scores is a React Native app I created for lovers of Football. With viq-scores you can check the scores, lineups, match events, match stats etc. A few benefits viq-scores provides
over other similar apps include:

- No ads.
- No gambling ads/information.
- Very fast refreshing.
- Clear UI.

Unfortunately, both Apple and Google blocked me from releasing this app on to their App stores due to a copyright claim by FIFA. Therefore I decided to deploy this app as a web 
app which can be access at: https://viq-scores.co.uk/.
